## Title Types Explained

### Clean TCT (Transfer Certificate of Title)
- **Best status** — clear, undisputed ownership
- Registered with Register of Deeds
- Full legal protection under Torrens system
- Can be mortgaged, sold, transferred freely

### CCT (Condominium Certificate of Title)
- Equivalent of TCT but for condominium units
- Includes undivided share of common areas
- Foreigners can hold directly

### Tax Declaration
- **NOT a title** — only proves tax payment
- Common in rural areas where formal titling is incomplete
- Higher risk — requires additional due diligence
- Can be converted to TCT through judicial/administrative process (lengthy)

### Mother Title
- Original title covering a larger parcel
- Individual lots subdivided from it
- Buyer should ensure subdivision survey is approved
- Individual TCTs should be issued from mother title before purchase

## Common Buyer Objections & Responses

### "Is it safe to invest in the Philippines?"
The Philippines has a robust legal framework for property ownership under the Torrens system. With proper due diligence and a clean title (TCT), your ownership is absolute and legally protected. We conduct thorough title verification for every listing.

### "What about political instability?"
Bohol specifically has one of the most stable and progressive provincial governments in the Visayas. The eco-tourism mandate ensures sustainable development, and property rights are protected regardless of political changes.

### "Can I get my money out if I want to sell?"
Absolutely. Foreign investors can freely repatriate sale proceeds. The BSP (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) allows outward remittance of investment returns with proper documentation.

### "What about typhoons and natural disasters?"
Bohol has a relatively favorable position compared to the typhoon belt. Premium properties include generator backup, elevated construction, and typhoon-rated engineering. Insurance is affordable and widely available.

### "Why Bohol over Cebu or Manila?"
Bohol offers the rare combination of international airport access, world-class natural attractions, lower property prices than Manila/Cebu with comparable appreciation rates, and a deliberate eco-tourism strategy that protects property values long-term.
