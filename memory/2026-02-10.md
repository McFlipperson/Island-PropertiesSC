# 2026-02-10 — Strategy & Financial Reality

## Nov's Bootstrap Reality
- **Cash available:** ₱100K only (day job deadline looming)
- **NOT a ₱58M runway situation** — this is scrappy bootstrapper mode, not investor mode

## Silver Business — CASH ENGINE (Priority 1)
- **Current:** Buying junk silver at ₱70-80/gram
- **Goal:** Refine to 999 purity using electrolysis + silver nitrates (permissions pending)
- **Product:** Bamboo 1oz art pieces, sell at spot price +10%
- **Current silver price:** ₱2.61/gram
- **Cost-per-lead:** ₱0.09-0.14 CAD per FB message
- **Waste rate:** 96% of leads are unusable
- **Daily impact:** 50 leads/day × 96% waste = spending ₱500-700/day screening junk
- **Time sink:** 3-4+ hours daily on useless inquiries

### Silver Bot Strategy (CRITICAL — TEXT FIRST, THEN PICS)
Nov has built a **precise reference system** based on:
- PH coins: pre-1945 only, specific weights (10c=2g, 20c=4g, 50c=10g, 1peso=20-26.96g)
- US coins: pre-1964, specific weights/fineness
- First Series (1903-1906): .900 fineness, Heavy coins
- Second Series (1907-1945): .750 fineness, Light coins
- 1936 Commonwealth: special .900 fineness

**KEY INSIGHT (05:02 UTC):** Don't ask for photos upfront. 90% waste photos of tables of modern coins/unmarked cutlery. TEXT filter FIRST.

**Bot Flow (TEXT → LOGIC → PHOTO):**
1. **Text Qualification (Bisaya):** Ask "What items? Year? Stamps visible? How much?"
2. **Reference Check (internal):** Check against weight/fineness table
3. **Decision:** 
   - Fails specs? "Cannot buy — reason: [specific]" (Done, no image cost)
   - Passes specs? "Send photo both sides, year clear" (Then analyze)

**Result:** 50 leads → 45 fail text screening (tokens saved), only 5 qualified get photos analyzed
- Current: ₱500-700/day wasted analyzing junk photos
- After: ₱100-150/day, same 2-3 qualified leads
- Time saved: 3+ hours/day

### Implementation
- Phase 1 this week: Build full Bisaya FB Messenger bot with text-first logic
- Test immediately with Nov's budget (₱6-7 CAD/day)
- Scale after proving token savings

## Island Properties — LONG GAME (Priority 2)
- **Budget constraint:** ₱5K for influencer video/drone/edit
- **Smart play:** DON'T spend full ₱5K yet
- **Test first:** Use mock listings + ads to prove ROI (₱500-1K)
- **Scale after:** Once ads work, invest in full video suite
- **Sophia status:** 95% done, waiting for Polly permission (AWS access)

## Model Settings (Locked In)
- **Default:** Haiku 4.5 (chat, everyday work) — 25x cheaper than Opus
- **Manual request:** Switch to Sonnet/Opus when needed
- **Cost control:** I'll recommend when heavier model makes sense, you approve

## Path to ₱58M (Realistic)
1. Silver: ₱100K → ₱50-60K/month recurring = ₱550-600K in 10 months
2. Island Properties: First video tested (₱1K), run ads, first lead
3. One property sale: ~₱2.5M commission
4. Repeat: 4-10 sales = millionaire

## Session Outcomes
- Sophia built 95% (voice, chat, mock listings, avatar, property images)
- Ad templates ready (English + Bisaya)
- Go-to-market strategy documented
- Silver bot design ready to build
- Spent ~$17 of $20 budget
- Everything backed up to S3
