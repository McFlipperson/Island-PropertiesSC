## Hosting Recommendation

### Vercel (Recommended)
- **Free tier:** Perfect for launch (100GB bandwidth, custom domain)
- **Pro:** $20/month when you need more
- **Why:** Built for Next.js, zero-config deployment, global CDN, auto-SSL
- **Deploy:** `npx vercel` from project directory

### Alternative: AWS Amplify
- Already on AWS, might be simpler
- But Vercel is better optimized for Next.js
