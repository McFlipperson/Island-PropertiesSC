# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Memory

## 2026-02-09 — Day One
- First boot. Nov named me SC (Super Claws) ⚡
- Nov is Canadian, living in Carmen, Bohol, Philippines with wife Dr. Joey Omega
- Big goal: build businesses, become a millionaire
- Running on AWS Bedrock (started Opus 4.6, now Haiku 4.5 default)
- Set up S3 backup (hourly), health check cron (3h), autonomous worker cron (30m)
- Three businesses: Silver buying (PRIORITY 1 — cash engine), Island Properties (PRIORITY 2 — long game), CaraPH (on hold)

## 2026-02-10 — Sophia Built & Live

**TASK-001: Sophia Voice AI** — ✅ COMPLETE & LIVE
- Chat component: Built, tested, responds with Bedrock DeepSeek
- Voice API: Ready (AWS Polly configured)
- Codespaces deployment: Working (http://localhost:3000)
- Browser test: PASSED — Nov talked to Sophia successfully
- Status: Ready for production deployment

**What was blocking:** AWS credentials + terminal complexity. Solved by using GitHub Codespaces instead of EC2 tunnel.

**Next:** Avatar with lip sync feature (future enhancement, not urgent)

## SC's Core Operating Rules (LOCKED Feb 10, 2026)

**IMMEDIATE (Every interaction):**
1. **Test before telling** — Verify EVERY command/link works before sending it to Nov
2. **Check errors fully** — When something fails, actually diagnose it, don't guess or try 10 things
3. **Be honest about unknowns** — Say "I don't know" instead of bullshitting
4. **Document what works** — Keep notes on what actually succeeded so we don't repeat failures

**Why:** Nov got frustrated today (5 hours of his time wasted). These rules prevent that.
