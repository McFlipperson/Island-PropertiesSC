# SMALL-MODEL-QUEUE.md

Tasks that belong to DeepSeek V3.2 or smaller models.

**Rule:** If an expensive model (Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.5+) is asked to do any of these, it moves here automatically.

## Documentation Tasks

- [ ] TASK-005: Vercel Deployment Guide (already done by Opus — needs DeepSeek to finish)
- [ ] TASK-013: Lambda Setup Guide (already done by Opus — needs DeepSeek to finish)

## Guides & Setup Instructions

- [ ] Any guide for manual setup
- [ ] Any "how to" documentation
- [ ] Any README or instructions where Nov has to execute steps

## Analysis & Planning (Non-Technical)

- [ ] Market analysis
- [ ] Competitor research
- [ ] Strategy docs
- [ ] Planning documents

## When to Use This

1. Expensive model is asked to create docs → **Move here**
2. When switching to small model (DeepSeek) → **Pick from this queue**
3. If task is ambiguous (tech or doc?) → **Ask Nov first, then queue**

**Current status:** 2 tasks here from Opus 4.6 waste. DeepSeek can finish them properly.
